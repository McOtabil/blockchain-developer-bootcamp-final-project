Final Project Idea : Onchain Yield Aggregator

This dapp will be designed to search for the highest yield available for the user held token on the ethereum chain, stake then collect staking rewards for the user.

Yield Aggregator Contract Workflow
1. User connects to dapp with their metamask wallet.
2. User deposits token based on available pools. 
3. User token accrues value based on the APY rate of user selected pool.
4. User can withdraw both principal and yield at anytime.

This is the most basic mental model for the dapp, it will later be updated with more features
